 # Muni_Tech
 
The whole procedure of complaining about a particular issue and then resolution of the same by the Municipality is quite hectic and complex. 
In order to speed up this process and make things transparent we have developed our Web Application Muni-Tech.
Through this platform any individual can just upload the picture of a place which is poorly maintained and not been taken care of, leading to it's detrimental condition.
The platform would simultaneously record the location from where the picture has been uploaded and would notify the municipality.
The municipality after completing it's required task would upload the picture of the same place as to how it looks after they have done their work.
In this way the whole procedure of municipality works would get easier and less time consuming. Moreover the work of the municipality would become very much transparent.
The spirit of self reliance and self help would be imbibed by the people henceforth because they would be responsible for their welfare. <br />
Further Devlopment Include <br />
Any individual can start a campaign regarding cleaning local places. Local Volunteers along with municipality can decide a fixed date with the help of the app and help cleaning the places which not only led to the cleaning of the environment but in a people unified Atamnirbhar.<br />

## How to get started‚≠ê (For AppK)?
Sideload apk files<br />

Before you actually sideload a file, you‚Äôll need to enable the feature. For security, Android prevents you from installing apps that come from outside Google Play. This prevents you from inadvertently installing a malicious file, but you can override it.<br />
The process for doing so depends slightly on your version of Android. If you don‚Äôt plan to sideload often, for safety we recommend turning this setting off after installing your app.<br />

- **On Android 7.x  Naugat and older:** 
In older versions of Android, sideloading is an all-or-nothing toggle. You simply need to flip a switch to enable installing apps from anywhere.
To do so, head to Settings > Security. You‚Äôll see an entry on this page labeled Unknown sources. Toggle this on, and your phone will display a warning that your device is more vulnerable to attack with this setting on. We‚Äôll discuss this shortly; tap OK to accept it for now.<br />

- **On Android 8.x and newer:**
On newer versions of Android, Google made a change to sideloading to increase security. Now, you must toggle the Unknown sources option per-app instead of globally. This allows you to install from certain apps you often use while keeping others blocked.
To toggle this, open Settings > Apps & notifications. Expand the Advanced section at the bottom and tap Special app access. On the resulting menu, scroll down and choose Install unknown apps.
You‚Äôll see a list of apps on your device that have the capability to install other apps. Select the one you want to install apps through, such as your browser, cloud storage, or file explorer. Then enable the Allow from this source slider.
<br />

### Methods of Installing anonymous apk 

- **Method 1:**  Install APKs Directly on Android
You can sideload apps directly from your browser on Android. Simply open a page that offers APKs and download it. You‚Äôll see a warning that the APK can harm your device; tap OK to proceed.
Once it downloads, you‚Äôll see a little banner with a shortcut to open it. Tap Open and you can install the app. If you miss it, you can tap the Download notification or open your Downloads app to reach it.
Once installed, just open it like any other app and you‚Äôre good to go.
- **Method 2:** Install APKs on Android via USB Transfer
This is the least convenient method, but it still works if you don‚Äôt want to use the above for whatever reason.
Download the APKs you want to install onto your computer. Then plug your phone into your computer with a USB cable. You may need to tap the notification on your device and change the connection type to Transfer files if your computer doesn‚Äôt detect it.
Open This PC and transfer the APK files onto your device. It‚Äôs a good idea to create a new folder to keep them all in one place. Transfer them, then you can disconnect the cable. (If you prefer, you can also connect your phone to your PC through Bluetooth and transfer the files that way.)
To install your apps, open your Android file explorer and browse to the folder with the APKs. Tap on each to install them, which results in a screen just like installing from a browser.
